# Capstone Project: Highly Interactive Honeypot System

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for our final year capstone project, where we have developed a highly interactive honeypot system. Our objective was to engage attackers using the ChatGPT API, allowing us to gather valuable data on their behavior. The system responds to commands by simulating a vulnerable system, providing insights into attacker strategies and tactics.

## Project Duration
